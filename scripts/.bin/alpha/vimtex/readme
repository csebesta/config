Requirements:
1. Open gvim and pdfviewer (evince) side by side
2. When one is closed or minimized, the other does the same (master, slave)

Even simpler:
1. remapped pdflatex command (F6) compiles document AND opens viewer in new background window. No script is required.
2. No resizing takes place.
3. Viewer can be changed with a variable.
NOTE: Opening pdf (appending extension) may prove difficult.
